# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull requests adhere to the following guidelines:

* Search open and closed PR's to avoid duplicate suggestions.
* Only submit CSS tips that you think would be useful to others. This implies each tip has enough succinct content to describe why it's useful.
* Add your tip at the bottom of the [README](https://github.com/AllThingsSmitty/css-protips/blob/master/README.md) document. Add a link to your tip at the bottom of the table of contents.
* Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com).
* Code formatting should follow standard [CSSLint](http://www.csslint.net) default settings, including:
  * Indent with two spaces
  * Use shorthand, e.g., `margin: 10px 10px 5px;`
  * Use double quotes, e.g., `background: url("logo.svg");`
  * Sort properties alphabetically
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* The PR should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!
